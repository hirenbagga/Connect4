# Connect4
This includes the environment.py we used for the class tournament I competed in. I've left my agent as well as another student's agent in the example.ipynb file. You can run this file to see a simulated game between our two bots.

I'll also include a notebook for you to play against my agent. This is the connect4_human_game.ipynb file. Just download it and run all of the cells. The last cell lets you play against one of my Monte Carlo agents set to a pretty high computation level. This means it's quite slow at the start, but it speeds up as the state space decreases. I decided against adding designated opening moves for this agent so be patient. Also, you can change which agent you're playing against.
Good luck!
